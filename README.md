### Design

The webpage was designed to the a luxury, mordern and minimalist approach to the customer. It is clear and sleek and gives the customer a insight of a highly professional and seamless experience they will get if they work with the business.

2. Colour
For the colour scheme neutral tones were chosen to match the images on the page. I chose the colours by inserting the images used in my project to the ['Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) website and searched for there HEX Code. The two colours I chose are #e9eceb for the body and #494931; for the footer. 
3. Fonts
The two main fonts are Gilda display which is the primary font with a fallback of sans-serif and Italiana which is the secondary font with a fall back of sans-serif. 
4. Structure
The page is structures in a easy, user friendly way. When the customers arrive on the website they are immediately welcomes with a logo of the left side and a familiar type of navigation bar to the right. The website consists of five pages:
1. A homepage with a section to subscribe to the newsletter
2. A about page with a descriptive insight of what the company is about and what it has to offer and a image of the founder and co founder
