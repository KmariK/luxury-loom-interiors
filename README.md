### Design
#### Design Choices:
The webpage was designed for a luxury, mordern and minimalist approach to the customer. It is clear and sleek and gives the customer a insight of a highly professional and seamless experience they will get if they work with the business.

#### Colours:
For the colour scheme neutral tones were chosen to match the images on the page. I chose the colours by inserting the images used in my project to the [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) website and searched for there HEX Code. The two colours I chose are #e9eceb for the body and #494931; for the footer.

#### Fonts:
The two main fonts are Gilda display which is the primary font with a fallback of sans-serif and Italiana which is the secondary font with a fall back of sans-serif.

#### Structure:
The page is structured in a easy, user friendly way. When the customers arrive on the website they are immediately welcomed with a logo of the left side and a familiar type of navigation bar to the right. The website consists of five pages:
1. A homepage with a section to subscribe to the newsletter
2. A about us page with a descriptive insight of what the company is about and what it has to offer and a image of the founder and co founder
3. A project page presenting the projects carried out by the company demonstrating to the customer their expertise and commitment to excellence
4. A contact page with a image of the company's interior design work, a contact form, a address and contact number and a google map so customers can find the showcase studio
