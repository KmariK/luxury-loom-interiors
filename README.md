- Colour:
For the colour scheme neutral tones were chosen to match the images on the page. I chose the colours by inserting the images used in my project to the ['Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) website and searched for there HEX Code. The two colours I chose are #e9eceb for the body and #494931; for the footer.

The two main fonts are Gilda display which is the primary font with a fallback of sans-serif and Italiana which is the secondary font with a fall back of sans-serif.
